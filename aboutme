Raghav Kumar Singh

Hello! I’m Raghav Kumar Singh, a Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Data Science and AI. I’m passionate about building real-world AI products using Python, PyTorch, FastAPI, and other modern technologies. Python is widely used in data science and machine learning
datascientest.com
, and PyTorch has become the dominant framework for deep learning
pytorch.org
. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework
fastapi.tiangolo.com
.

My interests span Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI. I’ve worked on sequence modeling using LSTM networks

 and built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
aws.amazon.com
 for knowledge-driven AI solutions. Driven by curiosity and consistency, I focus on turning complex ideas into impactful, practical solutions.
